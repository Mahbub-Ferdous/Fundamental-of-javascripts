// In javascript there have 5 types of operator :
/*
1. Arithmatic Operators :- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers like addition, substraction, division, multiply etc

1. +    Addition
2. -    KKSubtraction
3. *    Multiplication
4. **   Exponentiation (ES2016)
5. /    Division
6. %    Modulus (Division Remainder)
7. ++   Increment
8. --   Decrement



2. Assignment Operator :- Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables

1. =    x = y      x = y
2. +=   x += y     x = x + y
3. -=   x -= y     x = x - y
4. *=   x *= y     x = x * y
5. /=   x /= y     x = x / y
6. %=   x %= y     x = x % y
7. **=  x **= y    x = x ** y


3. Comparison Operators: Comparison operator mainly use in condition statements and getting boolen data type. basically its use to compare one value to another value

1. ==       equal to
2. ===      equal value and equal type
3. !=       not equal
4. !==      not equal value or not equal type
5. >        greater than
6. <        less than
7. >=       greater than or equal to
8. <=       less than or equal to
9. ?        ternary operator


4. Bitwise operator:- Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.


1. &        AND                     5 & 1      0101 & 0001      0001        1
2. |        OR                      5 | 1      0101 | 0001      0101        5
3. ~        NOT                     5          ~0101            1010        10
4. ^        XOR                     5 ^ 1      0101 ^ 0001      0100        4
5. <<       left shift              5 << 1     0101 << 1        1010        10
6. >>       right shift             5 >> 1     0101 >> 1        0010         2
7. >>>      unsigned right shift    5 >>> 1    0101 >>> 1       0010         2


5. Logical operators :- Logical operators are mainly and, or, not 


1. &&       logical and
2. ||       logical or
3. !        logical not
