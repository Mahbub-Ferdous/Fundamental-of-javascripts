// Varibles in javascript

// variable = vary + able  => thats means changeable and contains  different data type

// declare a varible without storing data only declared
var carName;

// declare a varible with data type :
var carName = "volvo";

// if we declare a varible than we should know about 5 things first

// {varible-keyword(var, let, const)} + {variableName} + {(= means assignment)} + {data with data type} + {;}
var x = 10;
let carName = "scania";
const is_there = true;

/* 
varible declaration rules :
1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter
3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
6. JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
7. Name should be one word

// javascripts data types : there have three types of data type in js = 1. 'string' 2. integer(numaric) 3. boolean

/* 
fundamental data types are:
1. 'string' :- string means rope that means one or more sentence called string and we aleays binding our string with single or double cautation like - 'my name is mahbub' and  "i am from dhaka"
2. Numaric/integer :- all kind of number with decimal or non dedcimal all are numaric data and we dont binding that with any block quatation
3. Boolean :- boolean means true or false which is mostly use in conditional programming where true = 1 and false = 0.
